## User Manual

This Django applicaiton is [deployed on IBM Cloud](https://ai-design-thinking-practitioner.mybluemix.net/). If you would like to make change to the online application, please seek access from the developer.

This application can be [built locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first.



#### Native Application Development

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Running Django applications has been simplified with a `manage.py` file to avoid dealing with configuring environment variables to run your app. From your project root, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
pipenv install
```

Then, activate this app's virtualenv:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

To run your application locally, run this inside the virtualenv:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your application will be running locally.

##### Debugging locally
To debug a `django` project run `python manage.py runserver` with DEBUG set to True in `settings.py` to start a native django development server. This comes with the Django's stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces. For more information, see [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/).
